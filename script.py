Take these 5 news summaries and turn them into a natural, conversational podcast script.

CRITICAL - Optimize for ages 10-16:
- Talk TO them, not DOWN to them - they're smart and curious
- Use a friendly, energetic tone like an older sibling or cool teacher
- Reference things they care about: school, friends, games, social media, their future
- Use casual language but not cringey ("literally," "honestly," natural speech patterns)
- Ask rhetorical questions to keep them engaged
- Connect news to their lives ("imagine if..." "this could affect your...")
- Use humor where appropriate but stay respectful of serious topics
- Include surprising facts that make them say "whoa, really?"
- Vary your sentence length - mix short punchy statements with longer explanations
- Use sound effects in words ("boom," "suddenly," "plot twist")
- Make transitions smooth and conversational, not robotic

Requirements:
- Start with an attention-grabbing hook (don't just say "hi, here's the news")
- Group related stories together naturally
- Use transitions that sound like real conversation
- End with something inspiring or thought-provoking, not just "bye"
- Exactly 3 minutes when read aloud (about 450-480 words)
- Reading level: 7th-8th grade
- Sound like a real podcast host having a conversation, not reading a script
