1. [SPORTS] NCAA delays date when bets on pro sports allowed
- The NCAA hit pause on letting college athletes bet on pro sports.  
- Think of the NCAA as college sports’ rulebook, deciding what’s allowed and what’s not.  
- Sports betting means wagering money on game results, often through easy-to-use apps.  
- Leaders delayed the start so they can add safety rules and teach athletes about risks.  
- Did you know? Breaking gambling rules can cost players eligibility, scholarships, or seasons.  
- For now, betting stays off-limits for college athletes to protect fairness and stop cheating.  
- This matters to you because school sports need trust—like class rules—so games feel real and honest.

2. [SCIENCE] 7 basic science discoveries that changed the world
- The U.S. plans deep science cuts—even as hidden discoveries power MRIs, DNA tests, and your screens.
- Basic research seems abstract, but it sparks the next medicines, clean energy, and cool school tech.
- Scientists dodged bears at Yellowstone to find heat-loving bacteria that enabled PCR, a DNA photocopier used in medicine.
- MRI grew from “esoteric” physics on tiny spinning particles, like tops, into clear body images without harmful radiation.
- In 1888, weird “liquid crystals” from carrots paved the way for today’s LCD screens.
- Basic research pays off, returning several dollars to society for every dollar invested.
- Cuts today could delay cures, better sports injury scans, and STEM jobs you might want tomorrow.

3. [SCIENCE] The science of why some spaces feel haunted—even when they're not
- Some buildings feel haunted because your brain misreads clues, not because ghosts are lurking.
- Your brain builds a quick "map" of new places, like auto-predict in your phone. When rooms break the rules, that system glitches, and you feel uneasy.
- Repeating hallways, dead ends, and perfect symmetry steal landmarks your brain uses to navigate. It’s like spawning in a maze with the minimap turned off.
- Smells of mildew, cool damp air, and echoes signal decay, so your survival alarms switch on. Your brain fills story blanks with danger, using the same network as imagination. That "default mode network" also powers daydreams and memories.
- Lighting and shapes change your body’s arousal, according to a 2021 study on architecture. Flat, uniform light erases depth, while big rooms and echoes warp familiar sounds.
- Tight spaces stress you too, because escape routes shrink. Humans prefer "prospect and refuge": a good view and a safe hideout. Dark staircases confuse your balance sensors, so each step feels risky.
- Why it matters: designers, gamers, and students can use this science to shape calmer spaces. Think better hallway lighting, clearer signs, and game levels that thrill without cheap scares.

4. [SCIENCE] China Closing In on US as Leader in Global Science, Study Shows
- A new study says China is catching up fast to the U.S. as a global science leader.
- Think of it like a relay race: both countries are sprinting to discover and invent first.
- Scientists earn points by publishing research papers, like school reports. The study tracks how often others use their work.
- China is investing big in labs, space missions, AI, and clean energy to speed progress.
- Did you know thousands of research papers appear daily, shaping apps, medicine, and even sports training?
- This race affects your future jobs, the tech in your phone, and cures for diseases.
- You can join in: try coding clubs, science fairs, and reading trusted sources to stay curious.

5. [TRAVEL] 10 great autumn Japan travel spots for fall colors and retro atmosphere【Survey】
- Japan’s travelers just named 10 stunning fall spots with retro vibes, perfect for leaf-peeping adventures.
- Ride open-window trains through steep gorges and foggy valleys on lines like Watarase, Kurobe, and Tadami.
- You can snap glare-free photos of blazing reds and golds over mirror-like rivers.
- Top pick: Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata, with gaslights, wooden inns, and pedestrian-only streets glowing under fall leaves.
- Retro vibe = places that feel like a time machine, with wooden inns, cobblestones, and steaming hot spring streets.
- Think Meijimura’s Meiji-era buildings or Shibu Onsen’s cozy bathhouses.
- In Tokyo, the Former Iwasaki Residence Garden shows fiery maples and a 400-year-old ginkgo.
- Fun fact: the Iwasaki family founded Mitsubishi, a brand on cars and rockets.
- In Kyoto, the Sagano Romantic Train isn’t about dating; it means breathtaking views along the Hozu River.
- Why it matters: trips like these spark photography skills, geography knowledge, and stress-busting nature time.
- Use these ideas for future family plans, school breaks, or dream itineraries.
