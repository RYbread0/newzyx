Hello and welcome to the Kid News Roundup! I’m your host, here to bring you smart stories in just a few minutes. Let’s jump in.

World
Russia is launching Intervision, a new music contest in Moscow next year to spotlight “traditional, family values.” It arrives after Russia was banned from Eurovision in 2022. Ukraine calls it propaganda, while Russia says it’s just about music. Big question: Can a music contest really stay non-political when countries disagree about world events?

Civics and Jobs
Senator Mark Warner criticized former President Donald Trump, saying Trump fired a prosecutor who didn’t find legal reasons to charge a political opponent. A prosecutor is a government lawyer, and many leaders say the justice system should be independent so laws are fair to everyone. What do you think—should elected leaders have a say in prosecutions?
Also, the White House said President Trump signed an order raising the H-1B visa application fee to $100,000. H-1B visas let U.S. companies hire highly skilled workers from abroad. Supporters say this protects U.S. jobs; critics warn it could push talent to other countries. How should a country balance both goals?

Tech and Science
A Tesla owner posted a video of his car’s Full Self-Driving mode slamming the brakes to avoid a spinning car on a highway. The software can steer, speed up, and slow down, but a human still has to watch the road. Tesla is testing in places like Austin, while competitor Waymo operates in more cities. EV note: Electric cars have zero tailpipe emissions, and charging with solar can shrink your carbon footprint even more. What proof would make you feel safe around self-driving cars?

Health
In California, Lidia Paramo spent months misdiagnosed before learning she has valley fever, a fungus infection you can breathe in from dusty soil. It spread beyond her lungs, causing pain and fatigue—an “invisible” illness. If you live or travel in dusty areas and get cough, fever, or shortness of breath, see a doctor, and wear a good face covering on windy, dusty days. How can communities support people who don’t “look” sick?

Sports
Football first: Retired Eagle Jason Kelce thinks the “tush push” play may be banned someday. It’s super effective for short yards, but some say it’s too hard to stop or unsafe. Should a league ban a strategy for being too good—or only if it’s risky?
Hockey next: Rangers star Artemi Panarin has a day-to-day lower-body injury and will likely skip a preseason game against the Devils. The team is being careful so he’s healthy for the real season. How do you balance rest and practice?

Entertainment
Singer Morrissey canceled two New England shows after a credible threat, and tickets are being refunded. Safety comes first, even when fans are excited.

Reality TV Corner
On Big Brother 27, Vince won Head of Household and nominated Keanu and Ava, with Keanu as the likely target. If the Power of Veto gets used, Ashley could be the replacement. With only five players left, every choice could shape the finale. Would you take out the biggest threat now or keep them as a shield?
